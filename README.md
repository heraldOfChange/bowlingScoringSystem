# Bowling Scoring System

## Game Mechanics

- there are a total of 10 frames per games
- in each game, you have 2 tries to knock down all 10 pins
- there are two bonus rules that apply until the last round (round 10)
  - if a strike and or spare was made in the last round the player gets an additional throw

## Strike Bonus

- a strike adds the score of the next two throws to the total score

## Spare Bonus

are when a player knocks down all the pins on the second throw

- a spare adds the score of the next throw to the total score
